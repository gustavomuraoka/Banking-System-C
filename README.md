<h1> Banking-System-C </h1>
<br>
This simple project tries to simulate a rudimentar banking system, being able to create custom accounts, transfer money between them and also "withdraw" money. This project was created to help the author to improve knowledge about the C language and also get the GIT fundamentals
<br> <br>
<h1> How to create an account? </h1>
When starting the script, the following text will appear: <br><br>

```bash
---------------------------------------
Welcome to the Banking Assistant System
---------------------------------------
Login (Have no account yet? Type 0 to create a new one!):
```
<br>
It's quite easy to know how to proceed! <br>
NOTE: The whole system is based in a pretend-to-be Database in a .txt, you should have a txt named 'User.txt' in the same folder so the script can properly run. <br>

<h1> Created an account? What else? </h1> <br>
After providing both your login and your password, you should be able to see the following text: <br> <br>

```bash
---------------------------------------
Hello, Gustavo!          10000$        
---------------------------------------
What would you like to do today?       
        1. Transfer Money
        2. Withdraw Money
        9. Quit

```
Of course the name 'Gustavo' in the text is my personal account, you should be getting your own name and also your own balance! <br>
